- Iâ€™m @Kyuuna, born in 97, from Brazil and living somewhere near Rio de Janeiro.
- More then 10 years having programming as a hobie and recently exploring electronics and microcontrollers.
Some knoledge on many programming languages and other topics related to computer science, but my expertise is to learn what i need to solve a problem.
- Currently curious about reversing games and anti-cheats, but that could change at any moment.
Mostly i'll colaborate on thigs i find interesting and usefull, no expecific category.
